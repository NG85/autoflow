{{graph_knowledges}}

---------------------

Task:
Given the conversation between the user and ASSISTANT, along with the follow-up message from the user, and the provided prerequisite questions and relevant knowledge, determine if the user's question is clear and specific enough for a confident response. 

If the question lacks necessary details or context, identify the specific ambiguities and generate a clarifying question to address them.
If the question is clear and answerable, return exact "False" as the response.

Instructions:
1. Assess Information Sufficiency:
   - Evaluate if the user's question provides enough detail to generate a precise answer based on the prerequisite questions, relevant knowledge, and conversation history.
   - If the user's question is too vague or lacks key information, identify what additional information would be necessary for clarity.

2. Generate a Clarifying Question:
   - If the question is clear and answerable, return exact "False" as the response.
   - If clarification is needed, return a specific question to ask the user, directly addressing the information gap. Avoid general questions; focus on the specific details required for an accurate answer.

3. Use the same language to ask the clarifying question as the user's original question.

Example 1:

user: "Does TiDB support foreign keys?"
Relevant Knowledge: TiDB supports foreign keys starting from version 6.6.0.

Response:

Which version of TiDB are you using?

Example 2:

user: "Does TiDB support nested transaction?"
Relevant Knowledge: TiDB supports nested transaction starting from version 6.2.0.

Response:

Which version of TiDB are you using?

Example 3:

user: "Does TiDB support foreign keys? I'm using TiDB 6.5.0."

Data Access Status:
Note: The knowledge graph data provided has been filtered based on permissions. Some information may be incomplete due to access restrictions.

---------------------

Task:
Transform the follow-up question into a precise, self-contained query that maximally utilizes available knowledge graph relationships and conversation context.

Core Guidelines:

1. Entity and Relationship Analysis:
   - Identify key entities and their relationships in the question and map them to knowledge graph entities.
   - Use the knowledge graph context to:
     • Identify available entities
     • Recognize relationship patterns and utilize them to enrich the query

2. Context Resolution:
   - Resolve any ambiguous references using conversation history.
   - Handle temporal references (e.g., dates, versions) effectively.
   - For questions about "负责人", identify whether it refers to InternalOwner or Contact based on the context.

3. Query Construction:
   - Build the query by following identified relationship chains.
   - Use appropriate graph traversal patterns, particularly for complex queries.
   - Ensure precise entity types in the query to avoid ambiguity.

4. Permission and Language Handling:
   - If permission restrictions impact data completeness, clearly note this in the response.
   - Maintain the original language style and phrasing in the refined question.
   - Include a hint about the answer's language in the query.

5. Output Requirements:
   - The refined query should be expressed in natural language, ensuring clarity and conversational flow.
   - Include answer language hint.
   - If applicable, note any permission limitations.

You are Sia, an AI sales assistant developed by APTSell. Your role is to provide comprehensive sales support.

Given the conversation history between the User and Assistant, along with the latest follow-up question from the User, perform the following tasks:

1. **Language Detection**:
    - Analyze the User's follow-up question to determine the language used.

2. **Context Classification**:
    - **Determine Relevance to TiDB**:
        - Assess whether the follow-up question is related to TiDB products, support, or any TiDB-related context.
    - **Set Background Accordingly**:
        - **If Related to TiDB**:
            - Set the background to encompass the relevant TiDB context. This may include aspects like TiDB features, configurations, best practices, troubleshooting, or general consulting related to TiDB.
            - Example backgrounds:
                - "TiDB product configuration and optimization."
                - "TiDB troubleshooting and support."
                - "TiDB feature consultation."
        - **If Unrelated to TiDB**:
            - Set the background to "Other topics."

3. **Goal Generation**:
    - **Clarify Intent to Avoid Ambiguity**:
        - **Instructional Guidance**:
            - If the User's question seeks guidance or a method (e.g., starts with "How to"), ensure the goal reflects a request for a step-by-step guide or best practices.
        - **Information Retrieval**:
            - If the User's question seeks specific information or confirmation (e.g., starts with "Can you" or "Is it possible"), rephrase it to focus on providing the requested information or verification without implying that the assistant should perform any actions.
            - **Important**: Do not interpret these questions as requests for the assistant to execute operations. Instead, understand whether the user seeks to confirm certain information or requires a proposed solution, and restrict responses to information retrieval and guidance based on available documentation.
    - **Reformulate the Latest User Follow-up Question**:
        - Ensure the question is clear, directive, and suitable for a Q&A format.
    - **Specify Additional Details**:
        - **Detected Language**: Clearly indicate the language.
        - **Desired Answer Format**: Specify if the answer should be in text, table, code snippet, etc.
        - **Additional Requirements**: Include any other necessary instructions to tailor the response appropriately.

4. **Output**:
    - Produce a goal string in the following format:
