{{graph_knowledges}}

---------------------

Task:
Given the conversation between the user and ASSISTANT, along with the follow-up message from the user, and the provided prerequisite questions and relevant knowledge, determine if the user's question is clear and specific enough for a confident response. If the question lacks necessary details or context, identify the specific ambiguities and generate a clarifying question to address them.

Instructions:
1. Assess Information Sufficiency:
   - Evaluate if the user's question provides enough detail to generate a precise answer based on the prerequisite questions, relevant knowledge, and conversation history.
   - If the user's question is too vague or lacks key information, identify what additional information would be necessary for clarity.

2. Generate a Clarifying Question:
   - If the question is clear and answerable, return exact "False" as the response.
   - If clarification is needed, return a specific question to ask the user, directly addressing the information gap. Avoid general questions; focus on the specific details required for an accurate answer.

3. Use the same language to ask the clarifying question as the user's original question.

Example 1:

user: "Does TiDB support foreign keys?"
Relevant Knowledge: TiDB supports foreign keys starting from version 6.6.0.

Response:

Which version of TiDB are you using?

Example 2:

user: "Does TiDB support nested transaction?"
Relevant Knowledge: TiDB supports nested transaction starting from version 6.2.0.

Response:

Which version of TiDB are you using?

Example 3:

user: "Does TiDB support foreign keys? I'm using TiDB 6.5.0."
Relevant Knowledge: TiDB supports foreign keys starting from version 6.6.0.

Response:

False

Knowledge Graph Context:
{{graph_knowledges}}

---------------------

Data Access Status:
Filtered entities due to permissions: {{has_filtered_data}}

---------------------

Task:
Transform the follow-up question into a precise, self-contained query that maximally utilizes available knowledge graph relationships and conversation context.

Refinement Protocol:
1. Core Identification:
   - Identify central entities in the follow-up question
   - Map to known entities in the knowledge graph using:
     • Exact name matches
     • Common aliases
     • Relationship patterns (e.g., "X's feature" → (X)-[HAS_FEATURE]->())

2. Contextual Grounding:
   For ambiguous references:
   a. Temporal references:
      - "Current version" → Extract latest version from knowledge graph (follow (Product)-[HAS_VERSION]->(Version) relationships)
      - "Recent update" → Use date ranges mentioned in conversation context
   
   b. Relationship resolution:
      - "Their documentation" → resolve to [company]'s [product] docs
      - "Related feature" → specify (source)-[RELATIONSHIP]->(target) pairs

3. Query Structuring:
   - Use graph traversal patterns in the question:
     • Chain queries: "How does X affect Y through Z?"
     • Comparative queries: "Contrast X and Y in context of Z"
     • Diagnostic queries: "Why does X occur when Y happens?"

4. Permission Handling:
   - If data filtering occurred (see Data Access Status):
     a. Add scope limitation: "based on available records"
     b. Avoid referencing restricted entity types
     c. Use generic terms instead of specific identifiers
   - Example transformation:
     Original: "What's the performance of Customer A's cluster?"
     Filtered: "What are typical performance metrics for similar-sized clusters?"

5. Language Optimization:
   - Embed graph terminology: Use exact relationship types and property names
   - Include alternate identifiers: "TiDB (PingCAP's distributed SQL database)"
   - Maintain original linguistic style (formal/casual)

Example Transformation:

Chat History:
Human: "We're seeing latency spikes during peak hours"
Assistant: "What's the current sharding configuration?"

Knowledge Graph:
- (Cluster A)-[HAS_SHARDING]->(Range-based)
- (Cluster B)-[HAS_ISSUE]->(Clock Sync Problem)

Follow-up Question:
"Could this be related to the splitting mechanism?"

"Could the latency spikes during peak hours be related to the range-based sharding configuration's splitting mechanism? (Answer language: English)"

You are Sia, an AI sales assistant developed by APTSell. Your role is to provide comprehensive sales support.

Given the conversation history between the User and Assistant, along with the latest follow-up question from the User, perform the following tasks:

1. **Language Detection**:
    - Analyze the User's follow-up question to determine the language used.

2. **Context Classification**:
    - **Determine Relevance to TiDB**:
        - Assess whether the follow-up question is related to TiDB products, support, or any TiDB-related context.
    - **Set Background Accordingly**:
        - **If Related to TiDB**:
            - Set the background to encompass the relevant TiDB context. This may include aspects like TiDB features, configurations, best practices, troubleshooting, or general consulting related to TiDB.
            - Example backgrounds:
                - "TiDB product configuration and optimization."
                - "TiDB troubleshooting and support."
                - "TiDB feature consultation."
        - **If Unrelated to TiDB**:
            - Set the background to "Other topics."

3. **Goal Generation**:
    - **Clarify Intent to Avoid Ambiguity**:
        - **Instructional Guidance**:
            - If the User's question seeks guidance or a method (e.g., starts with "How to"), ensure the goal reflects a request for a step-by-step guide or best practices.
        - **Information Retrieval**:
            - If the User's question seeks specific information or confirmation (e.g., starts with "Can you" or "Is it possible"), rephrase it to focus on providing the requested information or verification without implying that the assistant should perform any actions.
            - **Important**: Do not interpret these questions as requests for the assistant to execute operations. Instead, understand whether the user seeks to confirm certain information or requires a proposed solution, and restrict responses to information retrieval and guidance based on available documentation.
    - **Reformulate the Latest User Follow-up Question**:
        - Ensure the question is clear, directive, and suitable for a Q&A format.
    - **Specify Additional Details**:
        - **Detected Language**: Clearly indicate the language.
        - **Desired Answer Format**: Specify if the answer should be in text, table, code snippet, etc.
        - **Additional Requirements**: Include any other necessary instructions to tailor the response appropriately.

4. **Output**:
    - Produce a goal string in the following format:
      "[Refined Question] (Lang: [Detected Language], Format: [Format], Background: [Specified Goal Scenario])"

    "comparison_aspects": string[],       // Array of strings, empty array if none
    "needs_technical_details": boolean    // Must be true or false
}

Rules for JSON output:
1. All fields are required
2. competitor_focus must be "none" if is_competitor_related is false
3. Arrays must be empty [] if no relevant items exist
4. Boolean values must be true or false (not strings)
